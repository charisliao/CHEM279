# Welcome! 
In this repository, you will find my solutions to Problem Set 1 of CHEM 279 Numerical Algorithms applied to Computational Quantum Chemistry at UC Berkeley.    

This repository is organized as follows:
- `PS1/`: Problem Set 1 directory 
- `PS1/README.md`: This file
- `PS1/Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the C++ code


Note: In order for you to use the provided Makefile, you have to repleace the following line in the Makefile with the path to your armadillo installation directory.

```makefile
ARMADILLO_DIR = /Users/charisliao/Desktop/armadillo-12.6.2
```

## Problem Set 1
You can find the following directories in this PS1: 

- Bindir: In this folder, you will find the executable files from files in Tests.     
- Include: Stores the header files.
- Libdir: Stores the library files. (.o, .a)    
- Source: Stores all the source code.     
- Tests: Store all the test files.     
- Utils: Stores data and plots.
